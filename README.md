# TACTIC
TACTIC (Tangible and Tabletop Continuous Interaction) sends touch, tangible and gesture information to your HTML client

#Getting started
A new app starts by including the following scripts:

<script type="text/javascript" src="../script/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="../script/tactic.min.js" ></script>

And start the API with 

```javascript
$(function() {
		initTracking(true);

    .....
});
```
